     * Constructor for P1.TextFileProducer. To instantiate, a filename or source is required.
     * Next, three things are executed before the instance variables are assigned.
     * Firstly, an object of FileInputStream is instantiated. This class obtains input bytes from the provided
     * file or source.
     *
     * Secondly, an object of InputStreamReader is instantiated, which requires a FileInputSteam, so we
     * use the one we just created. This class translates the byte streams into characters based on
     * the chosen charset. In my case, no charset is specified and so the platform's default charset is used.
     *
     * Thirdly, an object of BufferedReader is instantiated. Wraps itself around the reader we just created
     * to simplify the process of reading the characters from the file (actually the characters in the reader-object).
     *
     * The instance variables times, delay and size are assigned to the three first rows in the file used. In this
     * case: 4, 200 and 10. Because the characters are String-objects, they need to be parsed to ints in order to
     * be assigned correctly.
     *
     * An array of P1.Message-objects with the size of times (instance variable) is created. The element of each index
     * is assigned with values from the read file.
     * To do this, Messages[] is iterated with a number of times equal to it's size.
